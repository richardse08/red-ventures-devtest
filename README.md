Developer test for Red Ventures

# After being supplied with a zip folder containing assets, sketch files (PhotoShop) for mobile and fullpage (1440 pixel +), and a JSON file of dealer information, I was tasked with creating a functioning singlepage front end web application

# With the exception of jQuery, this project was intended to be built without use of frameworks and libraries (i.e. Bootstrap, React, etc.)
